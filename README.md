# Railway Collision Avoidance System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Railway Collision Avoidance System using socket programming and pathfinding algorithms (A*). The system is designed to simulate real-time train scheduling, ensuring that tracks are allocated correctly and avoiding collisions by finding alternate routes when a track is already occupied.

## Introduction

The Railway Collision Avoidance System is designed to handle communication between multiple railway stations and a central server. Each station sends its track usage information to the server, which processes it and detects possible collisions. If a collision is detected, the system uses the A* algorithm to find an alternate route to the destination.

### Key features of the system:
- Real-time track allocation and collision detection
- A* pathfinding algorithm for alternate route calculation
- Communication between multiple railway stations and a central server via socket programming
- Web interface for visual representation of track status and updates

## Features

- **Collision Detection:** The system monitors track usage and identifies when two stations attempt to use the same track, triggering a collision.
- **Pathfinding:** If a collision is detected, the system calculates an alternate path using the A* algorithm to reroute trains.
- **Real-Time Communication:** The system uses socket programming for real-time communication between stations and the central server.
- **Web Interface:** A Flask web app that updates track status dynamically and provides a user-friendly dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for server-side and client-side logic.
- **Socket Programming**: For real-time communication between stations and the central server.
- **Flask**: Lightweight framework for the web interface.
- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: For efficient route calculation in case of collisions.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the Railway Collision Avoidance System on your local machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Railway-Collision-Avoidance-System.git
   cd Railway-Collision-Avoidance-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required Python libraries using `pip`. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure you have the following dependencies in your `requirements.txt` file:

   ```
   Flask==2.1.2
   flask_socketio==5.3.0
   ```

3. **Configure the Server and Stations**:

   - Edit the `config.py` file to set the server's address and port.
   - If you want to add more stations or change track assignments, modify the station scripts (e.g., `station1.py` and `station2.py`).

## Running the Project

### Step 1: Run the Central Server

To start the server that will handle track allocation and collision detection:

```bash
python central_server.py
```

The central server will begin listening for connections from stations.

### Step 2: Run the Web App

The web app provides a dynamic interface to visualize the track status.

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start a Flask application. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to view the track status.

### Step 3: Run the Station Clients

To simulate the stations and test track usage:

- Open a terminal and run the station scripts (e.g., `station1.py`, `station2.py`):

```bash
python station1.py
```

- Each station will prompt you to input the track number and the time for which it needs the track.

---

## Testing

Testing the system involves running the central server, the web app, and the station clients, and then verifying the following:

- **Collision Detection:** Check if the server properly detects collisions when two stations attempt to use the same track.
- **Pathfinding:** Test if the system successfully finds an alternate route when a collision occurs.
- **Real-time Communication:** Ensure that the station clients receive updated track statuses from the server.

You can modify station scripts to simulate different use cases, such as track congestion or collisions.

### Additional Notes:

- This system can be extended to include more stations, tracks, and advanced pathfinding algorithms.
- The web interface can be improved with real-time notifications and advanced visualization techniques.
