# **Railway Collision Avoidance System**

A real-time railway management application using socket programming that detects and resolves potential train collisions. The system employs the A* pathfinding algorithm to dynamically reroute trains, ensuring smooth operations.

---

## **Features**

- Real-time communication between railway stations and a central server using socket programming.
- A* pathfinding algorithm to find alternate routes in case of track collisions.
- Web-based dashboard for visualizing train and track statuses.
- Modular and scalable architecture.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Backend and socket programming.
- **Flask**: Web framework for dashboard visualization.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Web front-end for the dashboard.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8 or higher installed.
- Flask and Socket.IO libraries installed.

### **Steps to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/railway-collision-avoidance.git
   cd railway-collision-avoidance
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-socketio
   ```

3. **Run the Central Server**
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python station_main.py
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Web Application**
   Open another terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:5000`.

5. **Run Station Clients**
   Open separate terminals for each station and run:
   ```bash
   python station1.py
   python station2.py
   ```

6. **Interact with the System**
   - Use the terminal inputs of `station1.py` and `station2.py` to send trains on specific tracks.
   - View real-time track status updates on the web dashboard.

## **Modules Overview**

### **1. Central Server**
- Handles communication between stations and the system.
- Detects collisions and dynamically reroutes trains using the A* algorithm.

### **2. Station Clients**
- Represents individual railway stations.
- Sends train scheduling requests to the central server.
- Receives collision alerts and alternate route suggestions.

### **3. Flask Web Dashboard**
- Displays a visual representation of track statuses and active trains.
- Updates dynamically with real-time information.

## **Collision Avoidance with A* Algorithm**

- The A* algorithm is used to calculate alternate routes for trains when a collision is detected.
- It finds the shortest path between stations while avoiding busy tracks.

---

## **Results**

- The system successfully detects track collisions and suggests alternate routes.
- Real-time updates are reflected on the web dashboard for better management.

---

## **Applications**

- Railway network management.
- Disaster recovery and rerouting.
- Real-time traffic monitoring for railways.
